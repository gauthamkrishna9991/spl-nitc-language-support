# Change Log

All notable changes to the "spl-nitc-language-support" extension will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
- Autocomplete for all SPL Constants, with links to their respective full documentation.
- Hover-documentation for pre-defined SPL constants and most keywords (except `if`, `then`, `else`, `endif`, `while`, `do` and `endwhile` as it causes problems in parsing.)
